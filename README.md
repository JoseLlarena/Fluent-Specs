FluentSpecs is a Java API for fluent unit-level specification using a BDD/Gherkin format. It provides a thin uniform interface for
mocking, behaviour and state verification around Mockito and Hamcrest. 

Inspired by Hamcrest, Mockito, Fest-Assertions, RSpec and Narrative.

The current version only provides the most common subset of the functionality present in Hamcrest and Mockito.
